title: Faculty Handbook Revisions
date: 19 May 2015
---

Tyndale's Board of Governors last approved our joint *Faculty Handbook* on 25 April 2008. This week the President announced a process by which the entire faculty can participate in a major review of the document this summer. Ultimately, the goal is to have the Director of Human Resources present a fully revised *Faculty Handbook* to the Board later in 2015.

Review of the *Faculty Handbook* has been divided into four blocks, with four dates for each block. All faculty members are expected to participate in at least one session from each of the four blocks.

Block I: Intro, Sections 1 to 8.6 inclusively (2 hrs)
: Friday, May 22nd, from 12:30 p.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Wednesday, May 27th, from 2:00 p.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Thursday, June 4th, from 9:00 a.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Wednesday, June 10th, from 1:00 p.m. (Executive Boardroom)

Block II: Sections 9 to 13.6 inclusively (3 hrs)
: Thursday, June 11th, from 9:00 a.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Tuesday, July 7th, from 10:00 a.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Thursday, July 16th, from 1:00 p.m. (Executive Boardroom)
: Wednesday, July 22nd, from 9:00 a.m. (Executive Boardroom)

Block III: Sections 14 to 20.3 inclusively (3 hrs)

Block IV: Sections 21 onwards (3 hrs)
: Thursday, June 18th, from 9:00 a.m. (Executive Boardroom)

Because <abbr title="Tyndale University College Faculty Association">TUCFA</abbr> leadership would like to see faculty participate in this review to the fullest extent possible, it will post accurate and up-to-date information about the scope and timing of the block sessions here on [tucfa.ca](http://tucfa.ca/).

In chronological sequence the 16 scheduled sessions are as follows. If anyone has strong concerns about a particular block, then by all means attend and speak up at multiple sessions for that block.
