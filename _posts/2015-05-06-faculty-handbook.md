title: Faculty Handbook Revisions
---

Tyndale's Board of Governors last approved our joint *Faculty Handbook* on 25 April 2008. This week the President announced a process by which the entire faculty can participate in a major review of the document this summer. Ultimately, the goal is to have the Director of Human Resources present a fully revised *Faculty Handbook* to the Board later in 2015.

Review of the *Faculty Handbook* has been divided into four blocks:

Block I
: Introduction, process, and Sections 1 to 8.6 inclusively.

Block II
: Scope of review as yet unannounced.

Block III
: Scope of review as yet unannounced.

Block IV
: Scope of review as yet unannounced.

All faculty members are expected to participate in *at least one of each of the four* discussion blocks. Four different dates have been set for each block.

| Block I | Block II | Block III | Block IV  |
| ------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| May 22  | June 11? | June 18   | July 10   |
| May 27  | June 17? | July 16   | July 29   |
| June 4  | July 7   | July 22   | August 13 |
| June 10 | July 14  | August 11 | August 20 |

<!-- As announced by the President (but changed by Dianna)
| Block I | Block II | Block III | Block IV  |
| ------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| May 22  | June 4   | June 18   | July 10   |

Because <abbr title="Tyndale University College Faculty Association">TUCFA</abbr> leadership would like to see faculty participate in this review to the fullest extent possible, its will post accurate and up-to-date information about the scope and timing of the block sessions here on [tucfa.ca](http://tucfa.ca/).

In chronological sequence the 16 scheduled sessions are as follows. If anyone has strong concerns about a particular block, then by all means attend and speak up at multiple sessions for that block.
