title: University of Chicago's Statement on Free Expression

In 2012 the University of Chicago's Committee on Freedom of Expression released their "Statement on Principles of Free Expression." This statement is worth reading and considering how these principles can be applied to discussions of academic freedom/free expression at Tyndale.

You can find the statement [here](https://freeexpression.uchicago.edu/page/statement-principles-free-expression).
