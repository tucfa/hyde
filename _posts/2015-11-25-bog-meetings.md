title: "Board Meetings are Open to the Public"
date: 25 November 2015
---

One week ago the President of Tyndale University College & Seminary
[announced][press] that "a time for strategic visioning" had been
mandated by the Board of Governors. All who have an interest in
Tyndale's future will therefore want to pay careful attention to
decisions taken by the Senior Administration and Board of Governors at
this time. This obviously includes, but is not limited to, all current
employees of Tyndale University College & Seminary.

TUCFA particularly encourages Faculty members to take careful notes, to
give input as appropriate, and to participate fully in any and all
processes that bear on the school's "strategic visioning."

In particular, TUCFA encourages all Faculty to attend **today's Annual
General Meeting (AGM) of the Corporation and Board of Governors**. The
meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, 25 November 2015, from 4:00 to 8:00
PM and is **open to the public from 4:00 to 5:00 PM**. It will be held
in the B. Stiller Boardroom unless a larger venue is announced.

As a reminder, the [Tyndale University College and Seminary Act of
2003][act], which gives Tyndale royal assent to offer its degrees,
stipulates that "meetings of the board of governors shall be open to the
public and prior notice of the meetings shall be given to the governors
and to the public." Further, "no person shall be excluded from a meeting
except for improper conduct as determined by the board of governors."

The Board Chair does have the right to declare "part of the meeting"
confidential, and the agenda for tomorrow's meeting states that
committee reports from 5:00 PM are to be *in camera*. However,
hospitality is available from 3:30 PM, so there is a window of
opportunity become familiar with Tyndale's current Board members, and to
audit seven motions of the AGM. The President is also scheduled to give
an open report to the Board.
